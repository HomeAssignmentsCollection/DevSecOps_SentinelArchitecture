# Infrastructure Fixes Implementation Report

This document details the critical fixes implemented to address potential failure points and edge cases in the Sentinel DevSecOps infrastructure.

## ðŸš¨ High Priority Fixes (Implemented)

### 1. VPC Peering Race Condition Fix

**Issue**: Routes were created immediately after VPC peering connection without ensuring the connection was in "active" state.

**Impact**: Cross-VPC communication failure, deployment appears successful but traffic doesn't flow.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added `time` provider to Terraform configuration
- Added `time_sleep` resource with 30-second wait after peering connection creation
- Added explicit `depends_on` for route creation
- Added 5-minute timeouts for route creation and deletion

**Files Modified**:
- `infrastructure/main.tf` - Added time provider
- `modules/networking/main.tf` - Added dependencies and timeouts

**Testing**:
```bash
# Validate peering connection is active before routes
terraform apply -target=module.vpc_peering
aws ec2 describe-vpc-peering-connections --filters "Name=status-code,Values=active"
```

### 2. Network Policy Security Hardening

**Issue**: Backend network policy allowed traffic from ALL namespaces and pods, not just gateway.

**Impact**: Security breach, backend isolation compromised.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Restricted ingress to only gateway namespace using `namespaceSelector`
- Added specific rules for kube-system namespace (kubelet health checks)
- Improved egress rules with specific DNS and HTTPS restrictions
- Fixed YAML formatting and indentation

**Files Modified**:
- `k8s-manifests/backend/network-policy.yaml`

**Testing**:
```bash
# Test network policy enforcement
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/backend/network-policy.yaml
kubectl run test-pod --image=busybox --rm -it -- nc -zv backend-service.backend.svc.cluster.local 80
# Should fail from unauthorized namespaces
```

### 3. NAT Gateway Monitoring and Alerting

**Issue**: No monitoring for NAT Gateway failures which could cause complete loss of internet connectivity.

**Impact**: Undetected NAT Gateway failures leading to service disruption.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added CloudWatch alarms for NAT Gateway error port allocation
- Added CloudWatch alarms for packet drop monitoring
- Created CloudWatch dashboard for NAT Gateway metrics
- Added configurable alarm actions and monitoring variables

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/vpc/main.tf` - Added monitoring resources
- `modules/vpc/variables.tf` - Added monitoring variables

**Testing**:
```bash
# Monitor NAT Gateway health
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/NatGateway --metric-name ErrorPortAllocation
```

### 4. GitHub Actions Credential Validation

**Issue**: No validation that OIDC authentication succeeded, leading to potential silent failures.

**Impact**: Silent authentication failures, unauthorized access attempts.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added AWS credential validation step in terraform-apply workflow
- Added permission validation for EKS operations
- Enhanced error handling in k8s-deploy workflow with state validation
- Added role session naming for better audit trails

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/terraform-apply.yml`
- `.github/workflows/k8s-deploy.yml`

**Testing**:
```bash
# Test workflow with invalid credentials
# Verify it fails gracefully with clear error messages
```

## âš¡ Medium Priority Fixes (Implemented)

### 5. Resource Limits and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

**Issue**: Very low resource limits causing pod eviction and poor performance under load.

**Impact**: Service unavailability, poor user experience during traffic spikes.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Increased gateway service CPU limits from 100m to 500m
- Increased gateway service memory limits from 128Mi to 512Mi
- Increased backend service CPU limits from 100m to 300m
- Increased backend service memory limits from 128Mi to 256Mi
- Added HPA for both services with CPU and memory targets
- Configured scaling behavior with stabilization windows

**Files Modified**:
- `k8s-manifests/gateway/deployment.yaml`
- `k8s-manifests/backend/deployment.yaml`

**Testing**:
```bash
# Test auto-scaling under load
kubectl run load-test --image=busybox --rm -it -- wget -q -O- http://gateway-service.gateway.svc.cluster.local/
kubectl get hpa -n gateway -w
```

### 6. Dynamic Subnet Allocation

**Issue**: Hardcoded subnet allocation didn't account for different VPC sizes or subnet requirements.

**Impact**: Subnet creation failure, IP address exhaustion.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added dynamic subnet size calculation based on VPC CIDR and number of AZs
- Added validation for subnet allocation feasibility
- Added precondition checks for VPC CIDR size requirements
- Replaced hardcoded subnet indices with dynamic calculation

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/vpc/main.tf`

**Testing**:
```bash
# Test with different VPC CIDR sizes
terraform plan -var="gateway_vpc_cidr=10.0.0.0/20"
terraform plan -var="gateway_vpc_cidr=172.16.0.0/16"
```

### 7. Restrictive Security Group Rules

**Issue**: Security groups allowed ALL traffic from entire VPC CIDR blocks.

**Impact**: Increased attack surface, compliance violations.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Gateway EKS: Restricted to specific ports (8080, 443) from backend VPC
- Backend EKS: Restricted to HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) from gateway VPC
- Added specific kubelet communication rules (port 10250)
- Added NodePort service rules (30000-32767) for internal communication
- Removed overly permissive "all traffic" rules

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/security/main.tf`

**Testing**:
```bash
# Validate security group rules
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-12345678
# Verify only necessary ports are open
```

### 8. Automated Terraform State Backup

**Issue**: No automated backup of Terraform state before destructive operations.

**Impact**: Infrastructure drift, inability to manage resources after state corruption.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added state backup step before Terraform apply
- Implemented automatic rollback on apply failure
- Added infrastructure validation after successful apply
- Added timestamped backup naming for easy identification

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/terraform-apply.yml`

**Testing**:
```bash
# Verify backup creation
aws s3 ls s3://terraform-state-bucket/backups/
# Test rollback functionality by simulating apply failure
```

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### New Dependencies Added

1. **Time Provider**: Required for VPC peering race condition fix
   ```hcl
   time = {
     source  = "hashicorp/time"
     version = "~> 0.9"
   }
   ```

2. **CloudWatch Resources**: For NAT Gateway monitoring
   - `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm`
   - `aws_cloudwatch_dashboard`

3. **Kubernetes HPA**: For auto-scaling
   - `autoscaling/v2` API version
   - CPU and memory metrics

### Configuration Changes

1. **VPC Module Variables**:
   - `alarm_actions` - List of ARNs for alarm notifications
   - `create_monitoring_dashboard` - Enable/disable dashboard creation

2. **Security Group Rules**:
   - Specific port ranges instead of 0-65535
   - Separate rules for different protocols

3. **Resource Limits**:
   - Gateway: 500m CPU, 512Mi memory
   - Backend: 300m CPU, 256Mi memory

## ðŸ§ª Validation and Testing

### Automated Validation Script

Created `scripts/validate-fixes.sh` to verify all fixes:

```bash
./scripts/validate-fixes.sh
```

The script validates:
- âœ… Time provider configuration
- âœ… VPC peering dependencies
- âœ… Network policy restrictions
- âœ… NAT Gateway monitoring
- âœ… GitHub Actions enhancements
- âœ… Resource limits and HPA
- âœ… Dynamic subnet allocation
- âœ… Security group restrictions
- âœ… State backup configuration

### Manual Testing Procedures

1. **VPC Peering Test**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply -target=module.vpc_peering
   # Verify connection is active before routes are created
   ```

2. **Network Policy Test**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/backend/network-policy.yaml
   # Test access from unauthorized namespaces (should fail)
   ```

3. **Auto-scaling Test**:
   ```bash
   # Generate load and monitor HPA behavior
   kubectl get hpa -n gateway -w
   ```

4. **Security Group Test**:
   ```bash
   # Verify only necessary ports are accessible
   nmap -p 1-65535 <eks-node-ip>
   ```
