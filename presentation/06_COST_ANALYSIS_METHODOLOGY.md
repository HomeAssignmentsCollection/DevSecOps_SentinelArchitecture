# Cost Analysis Methodology for Infrastructure Projects

## Industry Standards and Best Practices

### AWS Well-Architected Framework Cost Optimization Pillar

#### 1. Cost Optimization Principles
- **Right-sizing**: Match resources to workload requirements
- **Elasticity**: Scale resources up and down automatically
- **Pricing models**: Choose the most cost-effective pricing option
- **Data transfer**: Minimize data transfer costs
- **Managed services**: Use managed services to reduce operational overhead

#### 2. Cost Optimization Design Principles
- **Implement Cloud Financial Management**: Establish cost governance
- **Adopt a consumption model**: Pay only for what you use
- **Measure overall efficiency**: Monitor and optimize costs
- **Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting**: Use managed services
- **Analyze and attribute expenditure**: Understand cost drivers

### Industry Standards for Cost Analysis

#### 1. TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) Analysis
```
TCO = Direct Costs + Indirect Costs + Operational Costs + Opportunity Costs

Direct Costs:
- Compute resources (EC2, EKS)
- Storage (EBS, S3)
- Network (Data transfer, Load balancers)
- Database services

Indirect Costs:
- Management overhead
- Training and certification
- Compliance and governance

Operational Costs:
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Security and compliance
- Support and maintenance

Opportunity Costs:
- Time to market delays
- Resource allocation decisions
- Technology lock-in risks
```

#### 2. ROI (Return on Investment) Calculation
```
ROI = (Net Benefits - Total Investment) / Total Investment Ã— 100%

Net Benefits:
- Cost savings from cloud migration
- Improved performance and reliability
- Reduced operational overhead
- Enhanced security and compliance

Total Investment:
- Infrastructure costs
- Migration costs
- Training and certification
- Ongoing operational costs
```

## Cost Analysis Tools and Methodologies

# Cost analysis by service
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=2024-01-01,End=2024-01-31 \
  --granularity MONTHLY \
  --metrics BlendedCost \
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE

# Cost analysis by resource tags
