# Rapyd Sentinel Architecture - Project Overview

## Assignment Summary

### Background
Rapyd Sentinel is a threat intelligence platform that requires a scalable, compliant, and secure architecture. The project demonstrates a proof-of-concept environment with two isolated domains:

1. **Gateway Layer (Public)** - Internet-facing APIs and proxies
2. **Backend Layer (Private)** - Internal processing and sensitive services

### Key Requirements
- Two isolated AWS VPCs with separate EKS clusters
- Secure private networking between environments
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Production-ready, modular, and secure architecture

## Solution Architecture

### Infrastructure Components
- **VPC Gateway**: Public-facing services with internet access
- **VPC Backend**: Private services with restricted access
- **EKS Clusters**: One per VPC for container orchestration
- **VPC Peering**: Secure cross-VPC communication
- **Security Groups**: Tight access controls
- **Network Policies**: Kubernetes-level security

### Application Components
- **Backend Service**: Internal web server ("Hello from backend")
- **Gateway Proxy**: Public-facing reverse proxy (NGINX/Node.js)
- **Load Balancer**: Public access to gateway services

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Terraform Validation**: Code quality and security checks
- **Infrastructure Deployment**: Automated provisioning
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Application deployment
- **Security Scanning**: Static analysis and vulnerability assessment

## Technical Stack

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure provisioning and management
- **AWS Modules**: Reusable, modular components
- **State Management**: S3 backend with DynamoDB locking

### Container Orchestration
- **Amazon EKS**: Managed Kubernetes clusters
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Application deployment
- **Network Policies**: Pod-level security controls

### CI/CD & Security
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows
- **OIDC Federation**: Secure AWS authentication
- **Static Analysis**: Code quality tools (TFLint, Checkov, etc.)

## Best Practices Implemented

### Security
- Private subnets for sensitive workloads
- Security groups with minimal required access
- Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
- No public EC2 instances
- OIDC for secure AWS access

### Modularity
- Terraform modules for reusability
- Separate VPCs for domain isolation
- Modular CI/CD workflows
- Clear separation of concerns

### Scalability
- Multi-AZ deployment
- EKS for container orchestration
- Load balancer for traffic distribution
- Auto-scaling capabilities

### Compliance
- Audit trails through GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure as Code for consistency
- Security scanning in CI/CD
- Documentation of security decisions
